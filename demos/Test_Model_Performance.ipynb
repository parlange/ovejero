The exact sampling that goes into the calibration plot is complicated, but the x axis repesents how much of the data the model expects to fall within a certain region of our posterior, and the y axis represents how much data actually falls within that region. Ideally this would be a straight line (y=x), but in practice our model is likely to be overconfident, underconfident, or some combination of both.
